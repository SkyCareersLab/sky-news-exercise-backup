Warm up exercise!

Try out the following tasks on the taskPage.html, which can be found the 'webpages folder'. Use this exercise to get used to the basics of HTML.
Feel free to experiment!

1. Change the size of the Sky logo to be double it's current size!
2. Change the page title to "Sky's Spectacular Career's Lab!".
3. Re-align the page's content to the left.
4. Fix the list found under "What emplotability skills will you learn" - they should have bullet points.
5. Add your names to the bottom of the page of the taskPage.html (i.e. Page Edited by Homer Simpson and Ned Flanders)
6. Make the link work (it should link to this page nextPage.html).


Congratulations, you should now be ready to develop a website for Sky!
