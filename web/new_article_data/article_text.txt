Usain Bolt Flattened By Segway After 200m Gold
**--------**

Usain Bolt was flattened by a cameraman on a Segway just minutes after clinching the world 200m crown.

In an incident to make insurers wince, the Segway veered off course after hitting a railing and took the gold medallist's legs from underneath him.

A shoeless Bolt, who had just beaten Justin Gatlin in 19.55 seconds to complete another brilliant sprint double in Beijing, rolled over before getting up and limping away.

The world's fastest man appeared to be okay after dusting himself down.

"He tried to kill me!" the 29-year-old joked to the BBC inside the Bird's Nest stadium.

"Maybe he was like 'He wins too much, let's take him out!'"
