            They have free apples here
        </p>
        <p>
            Isn't that really fancy? Shows they have money
        </p>
        <p>
            Then again it IS Sky isn't it. Makes sense I suppose.

            The lady on reception was really nice. Probably cause of Carol, cause
            they're friends.

            *hashtag* (cause i can't find the hashtag) connections
        </p>
        <p>
            I should just google where is the hashtag but that's kinda embarassing
            but I'm going to anyway.
        </p>
        <p>
            I googled it so #connections. Yeah I really don't have a story to write
            here. Okay, I lied it's not random. I'll conclude here, goodbye.
