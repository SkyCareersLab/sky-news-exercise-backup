                A 3D printing-inspired machine that can create any image on the foam
                of a cup of coffee has been unveiled.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            The Ripple Maker combines inkjet and 3D printing mechanics to replicate
            any image onto your frothy beverage
        </p>
        <p>
            The image can be printed in just 10 seconds, using coffee extract stored
            in so-called Ripple Pods.
        </p>

            Customers can download an app to send their own photos to the machine,
            which will then recreate it on top of the drink.
        </p>
        &lt;p&gt;
            With a price tag of $999 (&pound;634), it might seem pricey. But for
            a gadget that will see a coffee shop's products rapidly snapped and
            posted to Instagram, it could prove to be a good publicity opportunity.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        <p>
            As well as the up-front cost, there is also a $75 (&pound;47) monthly
            subscription fee.
