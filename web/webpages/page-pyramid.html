                Space experts are baffled by a three-mile-high triangular mountain and
                "mysterious bright spots" shining from craters on Ceres.

                    Scientists are investigating a mysterious, pyramid-shaped mountain
                    on the surface of Ceres.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>
                The triangular peak was spotted by NASA's Dawn spacecraft as it orbited
                2,700 miles above the distant dwarf planet.
            </p>
            <p>
                The mountain towers three miles above Ceres' flat surface - more than
                half the height of Everest.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Curiouser & curiouser. @NASA_Dawn sees pyramid-shaped peak," NASA tweeted
                after taking images of the mystery mountain.
            </p>
            <p>
                As the craft gets closer to Ceres - the largest object in the main asteroid
                belt between Mars and Jupiter - more and more features are beginning to
                reveal themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
                They include "mysterious bright spots" in a 55-mile-wide crater.
            </p>
            <p>
                At least eight spots can be seen in the largest bright area, which scientists
                think is approximately six miles wid
            </p>
            <p>
                They believe a highly reflective material is responsible for the spots,
                with ice and salt leading possibilities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dawn's infrared mapping spectrometer allows scientists to identify specific
                minerals on Ceres by looking at how light is reflected. Each mineral
                reflects light wavelengths in a unique way, allowing experts to determine
                the planet's rock and ice composition.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="news-content-right">
            <p>
                As the spacecraft sends back more images and data, NASA will learn more
                about the bright spots.
            </p>
            <p>
                Experts have also identified numerous craters of varying sizes, many
                of which have central peaks.
            </p>
            <p>
                They say there is "ample evidence" of past activity on the planet's surface,
                including landslides and collapsed structures.
            </p>
            <p>
                "The surface of Ceres has revealed many interesting and unique features,"
                said Carol Raymond, deputy principal investigator for the Dawn mission,
                based at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.
            </p>
            <p>
                "For example, icy moons in the outer solar system have craters with central
                pits, but on Ceres central pits in large craters are much more common.
            </p>
            <p>
                "These and other features will allow us to understand the inner structure
                of Ceres that we cannot sense directly."
            </p>
            <p>
                Dawn - the first mission to visit a dwarf planet - arrived at Ceres on
                6 March. It will remain at its current 2,700-mile altitude until 30 June,
                and then will descend to 900 miles in August.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ceres, named after the Roman goddess of agriculture, was discovered
                in 1801.
