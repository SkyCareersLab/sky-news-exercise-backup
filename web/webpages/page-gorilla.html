        <h1>Primal Instincts: Hunky Ape Has Japan Swooning</h1>
        <p class="sub-title">
            Women are apparently flocking to a Japanese zoo to admire a giant gorilla,
            with "brooding good-looks" and a "sensitive" nature.

                A giant gorilla who strikes poses for photos and has been described
                as "very good-looking" is being credited for attracting more women
                to a Japanese zoo.

            Shabani, an 18-year-old silverback, has been compared with a "male model",
            and has become the star attraction at Higashiyama Zoo in Nagoya.
        </p>
        <p>
            The ape, who weighs in at 180kg (400lbs), has been variously described
            as having "brooding good looks", "rippling muscles" and being "very attractive".
        </p>
        <p>
            Women are apparently so smitten by his looks that they have taken to
            social media to swoon and, according to the zoo, are flocking to his
            pen to take a peek.
        </p>
        <p>
            "He often rests his chin on his hands and looks intently at you," zoo
            spokesman Takayuki Ishikawa told the AFP news agency.
        </p>
        <p>
            "He is more buff than most gorillas and he's at his peak physically.
            We've seen a rise in the number of female visitors - women say he's very
            good-looking."
        </p>

            Shabani, who has been at the zoo since 2007, shot to fame after being
            made the campaign model for the zoo's spring festival earlier this year.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mr Ishikawa said the ape's paternal skills are also a big hit with women.
        </p>
        <p>
            "He's a father and he always protects and looks over his children," he
            said. "Zoo-goers think his kindness is attractive too."
        </p>
        <p>
            Women have posted comments on social media, describing him as "ikemen"
            - or a hunk - and likening him to a male model.
        </p>
        <p>
            A recent flurry of tweets has made Shabani a national celebrity, with
            Japanese broadcasters NHK and NTV featuring the gorilla on popular shows.
        </p>
        <p>
            "He will look you in the eye and sometimes if you're taking photos it
            will look like he's posing for you like a model," said Mr Ishikawa.
        </p>
        <p>
            "But he's the head of a group of five gorillas so it's likely he's just
            watching out for them and keeping an eye on you."
