                A guide to taking safer selfies has been issued by police in Russia
                after a growing number of personal portraits ended in death and injury.
            </p>

            Some 10 people have been killed and 100 hurt already this year in accidents
            while snapping hazardous images, from posing with a loaded gun or a hand
            grenade to climbing on to a railway bridge.
        </p>
        <p>
            The safety campaign uses road sign-style warning signs to highlight the
            dangers when taking personal photos.
        </p>
        <p>
            These include a figure holding a selfie stick on a rail line and one
            taking a selfie at the top of an electricity pylon.
        </p>
        <p>
            A leaflet published by the interior ministry warned: "A cool selfie
            could cost you your life."
        </p>
        <p>
            Tips included in the pamphlet include the cautionary note that "a selfie
            with a weapon kills".
        </p>
        <p>
            It comes after a 21-year-old woman in Moscow accidentally shot herself
            in the head while taking a selfie and holding a pistol.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the start of the year, two youths blew themselves up in the Urals
            while taking a selfie holding a hand grenade with the pin pulled out.
        </p>

            The mobile phone on which the selfie was taken survived the explosion
            to show what had happened.
        </p>
        <p>
            A teenager in the Ryazan region was killed in May while attempting to
            take a selfie after climbing on to a railway bridge and ended up touching
            live wires.
        </p>
        <p>
            Yelena Alexeyeva, an aide to the interior minister, said: "Unfortunately
            we have noted recently that the number of accidents caused by lovers
            of self-photography is constantly increasing.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Since the beginning of the year we are talking about some hundred cases
            of injuries for sure."
        </p>
        <p>
            She also said selfies had caused "dozens of deadly accidents".
        </p>
        <p>
            Ms Alexeyeva added: "The problem really exists and leads to very unfortunate
            consequences.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Before taking a selfie, everyone should think about the fact that racing
            after a high number of 'likes' could lead him on a journey to death and
            his last extreme photo could turn out to be posthumous."
