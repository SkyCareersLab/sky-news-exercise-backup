            Video captures the moment a pilot spots a moggy travelling cat-tle class
            on the wing of his light aircraft high above the ground.

            This incredible video shows a stowaway cat desperately holding on to
            a light aircraft as it glides through the skies of French Guiana..
        </para>
        <para>
            In-flight footage shows the black and white moggy taking up position
            just inches from the pilot and his passenger.
        </para>
        <para>
            The pilot notices his unexpected guest around a minute into the video,
            when the plane was already high in the sky.

        <para>
            He decided to head back to the runway for an unscheduled landing, probably
            hoping that the cat did not panic and attempt to jump in the meantime.

            After a safe touchdown, the cat stayed frozen to the spot until the pilot
            went to grab it, at which point it scampered off.
        </p>
        <p>
            The video was taken during a flight at aviation school Club ULM in Kourou,
            French Guiana.
        </p>
        <p>
            A caption on the video posted by the club said: "Routine maiden flight
            until ... the importance of looking into the wings before each flight.
        </p>
        <p>
            "For your information the cat is fine - it continues with its role as
            club mascot."
